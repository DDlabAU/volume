There are four "zones" above the table (beneath the ultrasound sensor) which represent 4 different states:

1. 0-50 cm: Deadzone: Nothing happens here.
2. 50-80 cm: Volume down zone: Hold your hand here to turn the volume down.
3. 80-120 cm: Volume up zone: Hold your hand here to turn the volume up.
